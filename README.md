# Sleeping-Beauty-Interface
It's an experiment of Brain Computer Interface + IoT.
A stub of application integrating an interesting framework for IoT development. I use this framework (cylon.js) inside a nodejs environment.
The goal is to reach the simplest, easiest and cheapest way to control "things," even for those who cannot or do not want to use standard devices

By Now it's just a stub ... but work is going on!
